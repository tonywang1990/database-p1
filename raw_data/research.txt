357	Tim Davis	Research Vision: High-Performance Combinatorial Scientific Computing
358	Tim Davis	The coming decades of high-performance computational mathematics will be increasingly dominated by heterogeneous computing based on hybrid multiprocessors with of a mix of conventional CPU cores and high-throughput GPU cores.  This trend is driven by power constraints and the need for ever-increasing performance.  Although these new heterogeneous systems can deliver high performance with low energy requirements, new algorithms must be developed to exploit them.  The most challenging problems for these systems require a mix of regular and irregular computation.  My research into direct methods for sparse linear systems lies within this problem domain and is also a critical component for many applications in computational mathematics.  
359	Tim Davis	My experience makes me well-poised for future research in GPU-based algorithms.  As a world leader in algorithmic research for sparse matrix computations, my work combines graph-theoretic methods and numerical techniques to create algorithms for solving problems in computational science that arise across a wide range of applications. I incorporate my novel theory and algorithms into robust library-quality open-source software, which is widely used in industry, academia, and government labs.  In the past decade, I have published more software in the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software than any other author (9% of the algorithmic output of that journal).
360	Tim Davis	A primary thrust for my current and future work focuses on creating parallel algorithms for sparse multifrontal LU, QR, and Cholesky factorization for hybrid multicore CPU/GPU multiprocessors.  The workflow in these algorithms is an irregular tree, where the nodes are the bulk of the work (regular operations on dense frontal matrices of varying sizes), and the edges are the irregular assembly of data from child to parent.  The GPUs operate on many frontal matrices at a time, and data is assembled from child to parent frontal matrix without moving it to the CPU.  No other sparse direct method employs these strategies for GPU computing.  By creating widely-used high-performance algorithms and software that encapsulate these ideas, this research will extend the capability of heterogeneous computing to a wide domain of applications in computational science and mathematics.
361	Tim Davis	In recognition of my research efforts in high-performance computing via GPU-based algorithms, NVIDIA has designated Texas A&M as a CUDA Research Center.
362	Tim Davis	Connections to Computer Science
363	Tim Davis	The core of my work lies within the domain of combinatorial scientific computing, which combines combinatorial and graph-theoretic algorithms with numerical methods, and hence relies on nearly all of classical computer science.  My graph and sparse matrix algorithms are important to several core areas in computer science, including social network analysis, computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics.  For example, all of the robotics projects at OpenSLAM.org that rely on sparse matrix algorithms to solve Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problems use my software.  One application relies on my sparse Cholesky update/downdate to process a dynamic set of images collected by a swarm of robots updating a 3D model of the region under exploration.  Robotics provides a promising avenue for future research and applications of my work in applied mathematics and sparse linear algebra. 
364	Tim Davis	Connections to Mathematics and Operations Research
365	Tim Davis	I have a long history of creating novel algorithms for new and challenging problems in applied mathematics and optimization techniques.  Over a 16-year collaboration with Bill Hager in the Math Department at the University of Florida, I have created the only asymptotically optimal algorithms for the sparse Cholesky update/downdate problem. This problem arises in dual active set methods in optimization, where the factorization must be updated as the basis set changes. I have also developed multilevel graph partitioning algorithms based on Hager's quadratic-programming formulation.  Optimization presents unique challenges for the development of sparse matrix and combinatoric algorithms, and provides a rich source of promising problems, including low-rank update/downdate of sparse factorizations, rook pivoting, rank deficient matrices, and finding well-conditioned basis sets.
366	Tim Davis	Connections to Industry, Open-Source Projects, and Government Labs 
367	Tim Davis	Industry, government labs, and open source projects rely heavily on my work.  My sparse solvers appear in dozens of commercial applications from The MathWorks (x=A\b in MATLAB), Google, NVIDIA, Berkeley Design Automation, Freescale, COMSOL, MSC Software (NASTRAN), Cadence, IBM, Mathematica, ANSYS, Mentor Graphics, and many other companies.  Every photo in Google Street View, Photo Tours, and 3D Earth is placed into proper position using my software via Google's Ceres non-linear least squares solver.  The US Geological Survey uses my sparse solvers to process images of the Earth, Moon, Mercury, and other planetary bodies, cutting their time-to-solution from hours/days down to minutes.  My open-source software has been adopted by all major Linux distributions, and is also widely used in open-source packages such as GIMP (GEGL), R, Octave, FEniCS, ROS (robotics), Boost, Julia, and scilab, to name just a few.  Sandia's Xyce circuit simulation package and Berkeley's OpenSees earthquake simulator both rely on my sparse solvers.  My software consistently demonstrates the speed and reliability essential for industrial-quality software.

741	J. N. Reddy	Professor Reddy is well-known for his research as well as for his teaching. Professor Reddy is distinctly known for his research on mechanics of composite materials and of computational methods, which deals with theoretical formulations and numerical analysis of problems in engineering. The shear deformation plate and shell theories that he developed and bear his name are well known and finite element models have been implemented into commercial software like ABAQUS, NISA, and HYPERFORM, which are accessible to engineers around the world. Professor Reddy has also contributed significantly to the modernization of our education, since his books are used as text books in courses of Mechanical, Civil and Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. An especially strong point of Dr. Reddy’s classroom teaching is the clarity and physical insight of explanations of even the most difficult topics through relevant engineering examples, but without compromising on the mathematical rigor.
742	J. N. Reddy	Such an eminent record of research has earned Dr. Reddy numerous national and international awards, including the Charles Russ Richards Memorial Award and the Worcester Reed Warner Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Nathan M. Newmark Medal from the American Society of Civil Engineers; Award for Excellence in the Field of Composites and Distinguished Research Award from the American Society for Composites, the Computational Solid Mechanics award from US Association for Computational Mechanics, and the Archie Higdon Distinguished Educator Award from the American Society of Engineering Education. Dr. Reddy presented the prestigious “The 2009 Landis-Epic Lecture” at the University of Pittsburgh, and received Honorary degrees from the Technical University of Lisbon, Portugal, and Odlar Yurdu University, Baku, Azerbaijan. Recently, he was honored as an Honorary Member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Dr. Reddy is one of the very few researchers in engineering around the world, who is recognized by ISI Highly Cited Researchers (with over 10,000 citations and h-index of 50).

932	Pushkar Lele	Bacteria possess well-known abilities to respond to environmental signals and rapidly adapt. Motility or cell-swimming helps bacteria respond to chemical signals in their native environment through a process known as chemotaxis.
933	Pushkar Lele	In our recent work, we have uncovered a paradox associated with cell-motility (Lele et al., Nature Physics,2015). In cells carrying single flagella (helical filaments that linearly couple flagellar-motor rotation to the cell's translational motion), motors exhibit torque-anisotropy with respect to direction. However, corresponding swimming-speed data appear inconsistent with time-reversibility of Stoke's equations, which form the cornerstone of current understanding of motion at low-Reynolds numbers. To understand the basis for such differences, we are investigating how biopolymer properties govern motile responses. Other projects focus on the rise of antibiotic resistance through cell-cell hydrodynamic interactions.
934	Pushkar Lele	Biological/Soft-Matter Assembly
935	Pushkar Lele	Self-assembly drives the formation of all biological systems, including a variety of nano-devices within living cells. Bacteria are colloids and brilliant nanotechnologists! One of the significant problems we are interested in solving are the unknown mechanisms underlying rapid self-assembly, in live cells, which govern short-time cell-adaptation. Lessons learnt from nature will be extended to develop new nanotechnologies for building synthetic bio-sensors and actuators, as well as drug delivery systems.

952	Efstratios Pistikopoulos	The objective of my research programme is to develop fundamental theory and optimization based methodologies and computational tools that enable process engineers to analyze, design and evaluate process manufacturing systems which are economically attractive, energy efficient and environmentally benign, while at the same time exhibit good performance characteristics like flexibility, controllability, robustness, reliability and safety. Our research involves three main strands:
953	Efstratios Pistikopoulos	Process synthesis and the environment: Here we are concerned with the development of process integration and pollution prevention strategies for the design and operation of plant-wide sustainable processes. Novel process synthesis modelling concepts are explored together with life-cycle and environmental impact assessment aspects, leading to new designs which feature step-change improvements in energy efficiency, waste minimization and process sustainability.
954	Efstratios Pistikopoulos	Integration of operability objectives in process design and operation: Our work here has centered on the development and implementation of novel analytical tools to simultaneously assess process flexibility, controllability, robustness, reliability and availability of complex process manufacturing systems and the systematic incorporation of these tools at the design and operational level.
955	Efstratios Pistikopoulos	Process optimization under uncertainty - theory, algorithms and applications: Here we develop the fundamental underlying mathematical theory, numerical algorithms and efficient computational tools for the solution of multi-parametric and stochastic mixed integer optimization problems, which arise in the context of the work described in the other two research strands.

960	Phanourios Tamamis	Computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations, are increasingly becoming powerful tools in the fields of protein structure prediction and de novo protein design. Despite the continuous advancement of experimental methods, computational tools have proved to be of utmost importance to fill crucial “gaps”, obtain information that is not accessible from experiments, and lead to the discovery of novel biomaterials and therapeutics.
961	Phanourios Tamamis	Through the development of novel multidisciplinary computational strategies, combining biophysical-chemistry and engineering principles, our research primarily focuses on the elucidation of the structures of key biomolecular complexes associated with specific diseases including cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes and the design of novel compounds that can potentially serve as therapeutics. In addition, our research deals with the design of novel biomaterials with advanced medical or technological applications
962	Phanourios Tamamis	Designing amyloid formation inhibitors to treat amyloid diseases:
963	Phanourios Tamamis	Amyloid deposition in human tissue is associated with a number of diseases including all common dementias and type II diabetes. A critical initial step to prevent amyloid fibril formation is to delineate the self-assembly properties and provide insights into the structure of amyloid fibrils of the associated peptide or protein in each disease. Our research aims at (i) elucidating the amyloid structures formed by amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, and (ii) designing peptidic and non-peptidic inhibotors of amyloid formation, as potential therapeutics for amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and diabetes diseases.
964	Phanourios Tamamis	Engineering novel peptide self-assembled bio-nanomaterials with promising applications in biomedicine and nanotechnology:
965	Phanourios Tamamis	Computational methods possess the capacity to provide atomic-level insights into the β-sheet structural organization of amyloid-forming self-assembled peptides, and peptide-based nanostructures. Our research aims at exploiting the self-assembly properties of self-assembling peptides and proteins to engineer novel peptide self-assembled bio-nanomaterials with promising biomedical or nanotechnological applications.
966	Phanourios Tamamis	Designing novel peptide inhibitors to dissociate key protein complexes involved in tumor-associated pathways:
967	Phanourios Tamamis	Targeting protein axes which constitute convergent nodes in pathways selectively activated in pathological angiogenesis and tumor cells may prove equivalent to a combination of drugs blocking multiple receptors involved in cancer. Our research aims at designing novel peptidic and non-peptidic inhibitors that bind to key proteins and may potentially serve as novel promising tumor therapeutics.
